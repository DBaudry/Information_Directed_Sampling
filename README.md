# Information Directed Sampling for Multi-Arm Bandit problems

Based on Russo & Van Roy (2018): Learning to optimize via Information Directed Sampling.
The aim of this project is to reproduce the experiments in the paper and to check new examples. We built classes to sample from different types of arm
in a Multi Arm Bandit. Then, different algorithms are implemented to solve the problem of regret minimization.

We first focus on three kind of problems: Bernoulli bandits with beta prior on the parameters, gaussian bandits, and Bandits with Finite arms (i.e finite parameter space, finite action space and finite rewards space)
